h2. Mathematica Textmate Bundle

TextMate is a popular text editor for Mac OS X. For more information about the editor, 
visit "Macromedia":http://www.macromates.com/, the author's web site.

Mathematica is a computational software program used in scientific, engineering, and 
mathematical fields and other areas of technical computing. It is created by 
"Wolfram Research":http://www.wolfram.com/.

This bundle allows TextMate to understand Mathematica .m files. 

It was created by David Howell and is being maintained by David Howell and Shad Sharma.

h3. Installation

Open up a terminal and navigate to the TextMate bundle folder:
@$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles@
*NOTE*: You may need to create this folder first.

Clone the bundle's repository using git:
@$ git clone http://github.com/dehowell/mathematica-tmbundle.git Mathematica.tmbundle@

By default, TextMate interprets .m files as Objective-C. You will have to switch the
language to Mathematica in order to activate the bundle.

h3. Stuff That Works (for the most part...)

This TextMate bundle is a side project for us and still has a far way to go. It is,
however, being actively developed.
