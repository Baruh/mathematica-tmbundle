h2. Mathematica Textmate Bundle

TextMate is a popular text editor for Mac OS X. For more information about the editor, 
visit "Macromedia":http://www.macromates.com/, the author's web site.

Mathematica is a computational software program used in scientific, engineering, and 
mathematical fields and other areas of technical computing. It is created by 
"Wolfram Research":http://www.wolfram.com/.

This bundle allows TextMate to understand Mathematica .m files. 

It was created by David Howell and is being maintained by David Howell and Shad Sharma.

h3. Installation

Open up a terminal and navigate to the TextMate bundle folder:
@$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles@
*NOTE*: You may need to create this folder first.

Clone the bundle's repository using git:
@$ git clone http://github.com/dehowell/mathematica-tmbundle.git Mathematica.tmbundle@

By default, TextMate interprets .m files as Objective-C. You will have to switch the
language to Mathematica in order to activate the bundle.

h3. Stuff That Works (for the most part...)

This TextMate bundle is a side project for us and still has a far way to go. It is,
however, being actively developed. 

h4. Language Features

 * Operators (there are a lot!)
 * Constants (@True, False, Null, Automatic, All@)
 * Comments (@(* This is a comment *)@)
 * Lists (@{a, b, c}@)
 * Parts (@[[1, 2]]@)
 * Some function calls (@FunctionName[..]@)
 * Strings (@"Hello World!"@)
 * Symbols (@thisIsASymbol@)
 * Named patterns (@x_@)

h4. Snippets

 * SetDelayed (Shift+Enter)
 * Module (module ->|)
 * BeginPackage (package ->|)
 * Begin ... `Private` (begin ->|)
 * If (if ->|)

h4. Other

 * Indentation on '[]' and :=
 
h3. Stuff That We Still Need to Do

 * So many things we can't list it all... your help would be appreciated. =)
